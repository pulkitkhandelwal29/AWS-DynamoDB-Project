# AWS DynamoDB Project

Assume that you are developing an application for Smart Farming using IoT devices.There are four fields in different locations. In each field you have placed IoT devices to collect temperature and humidity values periodically (5 Times in a day), which is used to get insights. The IoT deivices are identified using a unique DeviceID.
<br>
1. Develop a python application to store and process the temperature and humidity data in AWS DynamoDB.<br>
2. Analyse the data and suggest the system to switch on the sprinkler of the respective field if the average temperature value for the day is &gt; 25 Degrees.
